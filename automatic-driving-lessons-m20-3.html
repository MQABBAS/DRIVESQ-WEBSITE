  <h2 class="mt-4">Why Learn Automatic in M20?</h2>
  <p>You’ll practise lane choice, timing, and indicators at the junctions that matter locally. We make complex roundabouts manageable with repeatable approaches you can reuse anywhere in the city. In M20, you’ll rehearse along Withington & Didsbury Village, Wilmslow Road, Princess Parkway and nearby spurs, building route familiarity before mock tests at Cheetham Hill, West Didsbury, Sale. Lessons emphasise how to focus fully on space, speed, and signals and learn smoother braking and progressive acceleration with consistent instructor cues.</p>
  <p>Independent driving with signs and sat-nav is introduced early. That way, you grow comfortable with planning, positioning, and speed choice long before your test slot.
